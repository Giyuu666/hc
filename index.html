            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am <strong>Hugo Brouard</strong>, a Master's student passionate about entrepreneurship. My project is still evolving, but I am actively working on <strong>trading</strong>, particularly through buying, selling, and speculating on financial assetsâ€”mainly cryptocurrencies. Since a young age, I have been driven by the desire to create my own business.</p>
            <blockquote>"Work to achieve your dreams, or you'll end up working to achieve someone else's." â€“ Steve Jobs</blockquote>
            <p>I aim to combine my passions by building a <strong>portfolio management and investment company</strong>, where client management is based on their investments and a monthly return system.</p>

            <h2>Passions</h2>
            <p>Trading has become more than just a source of income or a professional activity for meâ€”it is a true passion. I spend hours analyzing charts, predicting market movements, and refining my strategies.</p>
            <p>Beyond trading, I am deeply passionate about <strong>sports</strong>, especially <strong>football</strong>â€”I am a PSG fan. I also enjoy <strong>video games</strong>, as they enhance teamwork, communication, and strategic thinking, all of which contribute to my personal and professional growth.</p>

            <h2>Qualities</h2>
            <p>I am an <strong>extrovert</strong>, always eager to meet new people and build strong relationships, both personally and professionally. <strong>Organization</strong> is another key strength of mine, a skill I continuously improve over time. Above all, my defining trait is <strong>creativity</strong>â€”I thrive on innovation and finding new solutions in an ever-changing world.</p>

            <h2>Vision & Future Goals</h2>
            <p>I admire <strong>Elon Musk</strong> for his influence, his revolutionary vision, and his ability to push the limits of innovation. In five years, I aspire to <strong>live in Dubai</strong>, a city I once lived in and one that deeply inspired me. Dubai reflects my ambition to evolve in a fast-growing, dynamic environment.</p>
